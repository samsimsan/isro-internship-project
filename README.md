# ISRO Internship project

### project name: 

Python GUI for hartley-huggins sensor

#### Internship period: 
16 aug 21 to 16 sep 21

#### Detailed Description:
The task provided to me was to design a python user interface to communicate with the sensor, which is being developed at ISRO and its motor mount through a serial communication port. 

The sensor was being developed to measure the hartley and huggins radiation band at the ozone layer. So during the testing of the sensor a gui had to be designed to measure its readings during its different testings. The sensor is actual a pair of two sensors placed on a trapazoid holder. This holder had to be placed on a rotary stage (PRM1-Z8) which was run by a stepper motor(thorlabs TDC001). The motor stage was used to move the sensors to different precise angles. The GUI designed had to be able to retrieve the live data from the sensor and use it to plot a live graph. The GUI was also able to give commands to the motor stage and retrieve the live angle position of the sensor.

The python script was later converted into an executable file so as to use it directly without a python IDE.
